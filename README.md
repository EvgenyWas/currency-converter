# Currency Converter

### [Watch demo](https://evgenywas.github.io/currency-converter/)

The Currency Converter app contains up-to-date information about exchange rates, the latest currencies changes and currency conversion capability.
It's styled using the Styled-Components and I used a spinner and an input-group of React-Bootstrap. For data fetching it's used Axios and I created useApi custom hook.
